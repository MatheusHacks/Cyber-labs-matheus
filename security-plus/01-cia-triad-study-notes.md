# Security+ Study Notes: CIA Triad & Access Controls

> **Status**: Pre-bootcamp preparation notes. Will be expanded with hands-on labs during Ironhack training.

**Date**: September 2025  
**Study Session**: 1 of Security+ preparation  
**Domain**: Security Concepts (1.0)

## üéØ Learning Objectives
- Understand CIA Triad components
- Identify access control models
- Apply concepts to real scenarios

## üìù Key Concepts

### CIA Triad
**Confidentiality**
- Definition: Ensuring data is accessible only to authorized users
- Examples: Encryption, access controls, NDAs
- Real scenario: Patient medical records in hospital system

**Integrity**
- Definition: Ensuring data accuracy and preventing unauthorized modification
- Examples: Digital signatures, checksums, version control
- Real scenario: Financial transaction records

**Availability**
- Definition: Ensuring systems and data are accessible when needed
- Examples: Redundancy, backups, DDoS protection
- Real scenario: E-commerce website during Black Friday

### Access Control Models
**RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**
- Users assigned roles, roles have permissions
- Example: HR role can access employee records, not financial data

**ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)**
- Dynamic decisions based on attributes (user, resource, environment)
- Example: Access granted only during business hours from company IP

## üîß Planned Hands-On Practice
- Analyze database access requirements
- Map CIA requirements to different data types
- Design RBAC structure for small organization
- *Will update with actual lab results during bootcamp*

## ‚úÖ Key Takeaways
- CIA Triad applies to every security decision
- Access control choice depends on organization complexity
- Real scenarios help remember abstract concepts

## üìö Next Session
- Authentication methods (something you know/have/are)
- Network security fundamentals
- *Will add hands-on Ironhack labs here*
